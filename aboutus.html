<h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>Girls Who Travel was founded in 2005 by a 29-year old business woman who desperately wanted to explore what's more out there, but didn't want to travel alone or feel left out as a solo traveler on a tour designed for couples.
   unable to find a fast solution that met her quests.<br><br>
   Apple Lilly spent 5 months interviewing women who expressed the same concerns and also shared the same values with her. That was when she met her business partner, Watermelon Rose, and decided to design a travel company that catered to the needs of young women traveling unaccompanied.</p>
